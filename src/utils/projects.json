We adopted an approach of urban renewal through the reclamation of railway and industrial wastelands, including burying a part of the railway line to materialize spatial continuity. The proposed action aims to develop a new landscape and functional centrality with a high quality of life. Our planning proposal targets objectives at various scales, involving new urban forms, improved composition of public and landscape spaces, and a reinvention of urban mobility strategies."
