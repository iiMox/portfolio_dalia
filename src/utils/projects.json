The goal is to reduce energy consumption, protect the environment, and ensure thermal comfort for the occupants.<br/> The house has a total surface area of 70 square meters and includes an open space that accommodates a meeting room, a kitchenette, a separate office, and a bathroom.<br/> The design features a compact volume with carefully selected inclinations to maximize the south-facing surface area, allowing for optimal solar gains during the winter while preventing overheating from the west during the summer months."

The house has two roof inclinations facing south, with one used for solar capture system protection and for installing photovoltaic panels, while the other is used for installing solar thermal panels.<br/> A porch is created for protection and can be used as an outdoor relaxation area. Active heating, cooling, and domestic hot water production are provided by a heat pump.<br/> A north-facing terrace is designed to facilitate access to the equipment installed on the sloping roof and creates an outdoor workspace."

The house is constructed using monomur brick, which has a thermal conductivity of 0.08 W/m.K and a density of 0.6 Kg/dm³, with dimensions of 14.8×30.0×24.9.<br/> This type of material has insulating properties due to the numerous cavities present in the brick, which function similarly to thermal insulation. Therefore, we have not included an additional insulation layer in the composition of the exterior walls.<br/> According to the Givoni diagram (20.2% passive solar heating with direct gain using thermal mass), we have proposed a system that combines direct gain and a trombe wall (thermal mass).<br/> The typical trombe wall is divided into six independent sections, each oriented at a 45° angle with respect to the glazing. These wall sections have dimensions of 800 mm by 300 mm, with centers spaced 1.2 m apart and a height of 2.0 m."
